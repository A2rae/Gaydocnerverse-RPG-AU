> rough ideas on weapons by -toast

***MAIN IDEA:***  
theres a bunch of weapons that can be found in the game, but only specific characters can use specific weapons  
each character is assigned 1 or 2 perferred weapon type and weapon attributes they are capable of using  

***WEAPON TYPE:***  
there are 5 weapon types currently avalible

**smash**: hammers, clubs, anything with blunt damage  
**stab**: spears, daggers, shortswords, pitchforks  
**slash**: swords, greatsword, axe, scythe  
**shoot**: guns, bows, crossbows  
**enchanted**: magic shit, literally anything tbh

each character can pick one or two from the list above to be chosen as their perferred weapon type  
any weapon can be equipped to any character, but if it doesnt match, the weapon's bonus is deactivated

***WEAPON ATTRIBUTES:***  
the current list of weapon attributes are: **light, heavy, thrown,** and **melee**  
if a character doesnt have an attribute listed, then they are locked out of using weapons that have that attribute  
not every character can wield heavy weapons or know melee combat yknow

light = can be used with one handed  
heavy = needs 2 hands to be used  
melee = punch  

***REQUIRED WEAPON INFO:***  
required information for each weapon for this system, writing it plainly without any specific layout bcs im eepy  
btw im imagining the weapons like theyr on a physical playing card

name: name of the weapon 
weapon type: one weapon type  
weapon attribute(s): optional one or more weapon attribute  
effect: what the weapon does when equipped  
bonus: a small bonus effect that activates when the character using the weapon is proficient  
flavor text: description or something silly  
set: weapons that belong in one set all follow a theme (example, space, or they all have simmilar effects)  

example weapon time except i use alrd existing weapons:  

**Clown Scythe**  
Slash (Heavy) - ???  
\* singular target attacks have a 75% chance of dealing damage to 2 enemies instead  
\* bonus: 25% chance of transfering all status condition on this character to an enemy   
what kind of clown uses a red and black scythe???

**Rosey's Cards**  
Enchanted - Greenhill  
\* when an enemy is hit by any attack from this character for the first time, reveal the enemy's stats and weaknesses  
\* bonus: +2% damage each time a turn passes  
predicts the future with a 0% accuracy rate

**Giant Stale Croissant**  
Smash (Light, Throwable)  
\* extra button in skill list to eat the croissant  
\* +20% damage, when eaten recover 10 hp  
\* bonus: 15% chance of dealing 400% damage and immediately breaking  
feels like a rock painted to look like a croissant
