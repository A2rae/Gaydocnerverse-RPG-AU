> *An odd entity that can take the form of anyone it pleases (as it claims) that belongs to the Kaza Protection Squad. A2rae constantly brainstorms ideas for whatever new project they are working on whenever they can, even in battle. For this time, they decided to take on a rather simplified form to distinguish themself. Also calls themself “the Creator” for some reason.*
