## Party/Team
a team/party consists of 5 [CHARACTERS](../characters)! you can change who is on your team (whenever outside combat? at a specific place?)
you will be using this team to deal with combat and exploring the overworld

each character is unique in how they contribute to the team so choose whichever team combinations fit you the most!

> btw do we have a standard attack button that doesnt require `kB`? -toast

## kB and MB (mana and currency system)
every ability needs a certain amount of `kB` to be performed  
the `kB bar` starts out empty at the start of each battle and can be filled by attacking enemies, every character use the same `kB bar`

excess `kB` gets turned into `MB` at the end of each battle using this formula:
```
((% fullness of kB bar) Ã— 0.5) rounded up = MB
if the kB bar is 100% full, 60 MB is recieved
```
`MB` is used as currency to buy and or upgrade items
