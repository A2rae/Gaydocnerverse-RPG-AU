### kB and MB (mana and currency system)
every ability needs a certain amount of `kB` to be performed  
the `kB bar` starts out empty at the start of each battle and can be filled by attacking enemies, every character use the same `kB bar`

excess `kB` gets turned into `MB` at the end of each battle using this formula:
```
((% fullness of kB bar) Ã— 0.5) rounded up = MB
if the kB bar is 100% full, 60 MB is recieved
```
`MB` is used as currency to buy and or upgrade items
