## Party
a team/party consists of 5 [CHARACTERS](../characters)! you can change who is on your party (whenever outside combat? at a specific place?)
you will be using this team to deal with combat and exploring the overworld

each character is unique in how they contribute to the team so choose whichever team combinations fit you the most!

## kB and MB (mana and currency system)
every ability needs a certain amount of `kB` to be performed  
the `kB bar` starts out empty at the start of each battle and can be filled by attacking enemies, every character use the same `kB bar`

excess `kB` gets turned into `MB` at the end of each battle using this formula:
```
((% fullness of kB bar) Ã— 0.5) rounded up = MB
if the kB bar is 100% full, 60 MB is recieved
```
`MB` is used as currency to buy and or upgrade items

## Stats
your STATS determine how strong you are, of course your STATS get stronger each time you level up.  some [ITEMS](./Items.md) can also boost certain stats when equiped

**HP:** health points! hit 0 and that character dies(?)  
**ATK:** attack power! the standard STAT that determines how strong your attacks are  
**DEF:** defence! how do u explain defence help  
**SPD:** speed! characters with higher speed than others move first and have a chance of evading some attacks  

### Standard Base Stats
HP: 100-200

## Battle
the system works similarly to traditional RPGs, each character can defend, use abilities, or use items in their turn  
the standard attack button is replaced with defend, which generates 10 kB and blocks incoming damage for 25%
